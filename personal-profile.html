                <h1>Personal Profile</h1>
                <p>
                    I took a Myers-Brigg personality test to understand what category my personality
                    most closely relates to. The personality type I was chosen was Virtuoso which indicates
                    how curious I am about the world and how it functions as well as starting lots of projects
                    that allow me to build creative things. I personally agree to an extent that this applies to
                    me as long as there are sure measures of my safety when performing tasks and projects. The
                    personality indicates that I love to share my work with others which I do not personally
                    agree applies to me. A Virtuous person is someone who holds strong values and will abide by
                    them more than other types of people. I somewhat have this trait when it comes to the way I
                    like to work or complete tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My personality indicates that I would be able to get along with others who share similar 
                    interests to me which I think applies for a majority of people. I personally think that I 
                    am not among the majority as I even struggle to discuss topics I like. I find this will 
                    become a challenge when we move on to group assignments in the future and my personality 
                    type supports how I like others to do work. When I am forced to choose people to work with, 
                    Virtuoso people are best suited to work with other Virtuoso personality types which I think 
                    I will use when considering my workmates.
