                    I took a Myers-Brigg personality test to understand what category my personality
                    most closely relates to. The personality type I was chosen was Virtuoso which indicates
                    how curious I am about the world and how it functions as well as starting lots of projects
                    that allow me to build creative things. I personally agree to an extent that this applies to
                    me as long as there are sure measures of my safety when performing tasks and projects. The
                    personality indicates that I love to share my work with others which I do not personally
                    agree applies to me. A Virtuous person is someone who holds strong values and will abide by
                    them more than other types of people. I somewhat have this trait when it comes to the way I
                    like to work or complete tasks.

                    My personality indicates that I would be able to get along with others who share similar 
                    interests to me which I think applies for a majority of people. I personally think that I 
                    am not among the majority as I even struggle to discuss topics I like. I find this will 
                    become a challenge when we move on to group assignments in the future and my personality 
                    type supports how I like others to do work. When I am forced to choose people to work with, 
                    Virtuoso people are best suited to work with other Virtuoso personality types which I think 
                    I will use when considering my workmates.

                    Another personality test that I took was the Big Five Personality test or OCEAN test that takes
                    five traits and ranks them amongst the global population. The traits are referred to as Openness,
                    Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. My test shows that I have above
                    average Openness, below average Extraversion and expected Conscientiousness, Agreeableness and Neuroticism.
                    The test indicates that my results show that I have a creative and intelligent mind but I have trouble communicating
                    those ideas to other people. It also indicates that I have less negative emotions and high tolerance so it would be very
                    easy for others (such as my workmates) to have comfortable thoughts about me when performing work.

                    The next personality test that I performed was a psychometric test similar to the Big-Five and the Myers-Brigg, this test
                    takes into account different traits to determine my work style when cooperating in jobs or group tasks. The general summary
                    of the results show that I tend to avoid social situations as much as possible even if I gain a serious loss in the process
                    which I definitely agree with as I have known myself to avoid difficult situations all the time. The traits of my test
                    (Extraversion, Introversion, Thinking, Feeling, Sensing, Intuition, Judgment, Perception, Emotional Stability) are similar
                    to that of my Big-Five test which I believe indicates either how consistent the tests are or the data I am feeding them. One
                    thing that this test has in common with the others is how I tend to work best with others like me which I will try to consider
                    when selecting members to pick for future group assignemnts.
