            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">
                I was born in Sydney and I moved to Melbourne to be closer to all of my family when I was the age of five years old. I developed an interest in IT when my father started showing me how to code in Java and from there I have developed a keen interest in all things computer related such as Application Development and Cyber Hacking. I just recently finished highschool and I saw this subject on the RMIT website and I thought about the different pathways I could take upon completion but one of the main reasons for choosing this subject was so that I could get a grasp on how the IT department works in the real world.
                I expect by the end of the subject I will be able to understand and apply IT concepts to my career, projects and life.
