                <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;">
                    My ideal job would be a job that would allow me to have reasonable pay 
                    and flexibility when working as well as handling complications as minimal as possible.
                    It would mainly include somewhere where I can travel to easily such as one located in
                    Melbourne or working from home. It would also include working with as little people as possible.
                    On Seek, I found a position that I think I would love to fill which is a software developer position
                    at Idea11 indicates most of these requirements such as working from home and having reasonable pay.
                    This position also has requirements that increase your chances of being hired such as a degree in Bachelor of IT.
